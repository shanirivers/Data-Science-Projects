    "\n",
    "Default value: The default is set to 25 iterations, balancing thoroughness and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: It limits how many times an agent will attempt to complete a task before giving its best answer.\n",

    "Usage: You can set this attribute when initializing an agent. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "agent = Agent(\n",
    "  role='Research Analyst',\n",
    "  goal='Provide up-to-date market analysis',\n",

    "  max_iter=25,  # Set maximum iterations\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Behavior: As the agent approaches the maximum number of iterations, it will try to provide the best possible answer based on its current progress.\n",

    "Customization: You can adjust this value based on your specific needs, allowing for more or fewer attempts depending on the complexity of the task."
