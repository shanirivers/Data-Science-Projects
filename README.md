# Data Science Projects Repository

Welcome to my Data Science Projects Repository! 

This repository is a collection of various data science projects that I've worked on. This repository contains a collection of projects that showcase my skills and learning journey in data science and machine learning.

## Self-Directed Projects

These are projects I've undertaken independently to explore new concepts, apply what I've learned, and challenge myself with real-world data science problems.

- **Project: AI Investor Bot**
  - **Description:** This repository documents the process of building an AI-powered bot to identify value stocks using financial data from [SimFin](https://www.simfin.com). The project involves several steps.
  - **Skills Practiced:** Data cleaning, preliminary analysis, exploratory data analysis, value stock metrics, implementation of ML algorithms to make investment decisions.
  - **Link to Notebook:** [Data Cleaning Notebook](notebooks/Stock_Data_Cleanup.ipynb)

- **Project: Vaccine status and mortality**
  - **Description:** The respository documents the analysis of current data from the [Office of National Statistics - UK](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/deathsbyvaccinationstatusengland) to analysis deaths by vaccination status. Note: The dataset will not be uploaded to this repository as it can be easily obtained from the source. 
  - **Skills Practiced:** Data cleaning, preliminary analysis, exploratory data analysis.
  - **Link to Notebook:** [Project B Notebook](link-to-notebook)
    
## Coursework Projects

These are select projects completed as part of my data science and machine learning coursework from Codecedemy. Each project is designed to address specific learning objectives and apply theoretical concepts to practical problems.

- **Project 1: Sales Funnel**
  - **Description:** Analyze website visits data and sales funnel.
  - **Skills Practiced:** Data import, data cleaning, Pandas library
  - **Link to Notebook:** [Project 1 Notebook](link-to-notebook)

- **Project 2: Jeopardy**
  - **Description:** Investigate a dataset of Jeopardy! questions and answers. Filter the dataset for topics, compute the average difficulty of those questions, and train to become the next Jeopardy champion!
  - **Skills Practiced:** Data import, data cleaning, Pandas library
  - **Link to Notebook:** [Project 2 Notebook](link-to-notebook)

## About Me

I am a passionate about data! With a background in supporting and maintaining data for SaaS web application for almost a decade, I am transitioning into the field of data science, focusing on practical applications of data analysis and machine learning. I currently learning through various online courses (LinkedIn course and Codecedemy), books and self-directed projects.
