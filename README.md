# Data Science Projects Repository

Welcome to my Data Science Projects Repository! 

This repository is a collection of various data science projects that I've worked on. This repository contains a collection of projects that showcase my skills and learning journey in data science and machine learning.

## Self-Directed Projects

These are projects I've undertaken independently to explore new concepts, apply what I've learned, and challenge myself with real-world data science problems.

- **Project: AI Investor Bot**
  - **Description:** This repository documents the process of building an AI-powered bot to identify value stocks using financial data from [SimFin](https://www.simfin.com). The project involves several steps.
  - **Skills Practiced:** Data cleaning, preliminary analysis, exploratory data analysis, value stock metrics, implementation of ML algorithms to make investment decisions.
  - **Link to Notebook:** [Data Cleaning Notebook](https://github.com/shanirivers/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/notebooks/Self-Directed%20Projects/Stock_Data_Cleanup.ipynb)
  - **Link to Notebook:** [EDA & Initial Analysis Notebook](https://github.com/shanirivers/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/notebooks/Self-Directed%20Projects/Investor_AI_Initial_EDA.ipynb)

- **Project: Vaccine status and mortality**
  - **Description:** The respository documents the analysis of current data from the [Office of National Statistics - UK](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/deathsbyvaccinationstatusengland) to analysis deaths by vaccination status. Note: The dataset will not be uploaded to this repository as it can be easily obtained from the source. 
  - **Skills Practiced:** Data cleaning, preliminary analysis, exploratory data analysis.
  - **Link to Notebook:** [Project B Notebook](link-to-notebook)
    
## Coursework Projects

These are select projects completed as part of my data science and machine learning coursework from Codecedemy. Each project is designed to address specific learning objectives and apply theoretical concepts to practical problems.

- **Project 1: Sales Funnel**
  - **Description:** Analyze website visits data and sales funnel.
  - **Skills Practiced:** Data import, Pandas library: column operations, aggregates, working with multiple dataframes, merge
  - **Link to Notebook:** [Project 1 Notebook](https://github.com/shanirivers/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/notebooks/Coursework%20Projects/Page_Funnel_Visits.ipynb)

- **Project 2: US Census**
  - **Description:** Cleaning US Census data
  - **Skills Practiced:** Data import, data cleaning, Pandas library, graphs
  - **Link to Notebook:** [Project 2 Notebook](https://github.com/shanirivers/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/notebooks/Coursework%20Projects/Cleaning%20US%20Census%20Data.ipynb)

- **Project 3: Web Scraping**
  - **Description:** Web scrap data from a website table using the BeautifulSoup library.
  - **Skills Practiced:** Web scraping, data import, data cleaning, Pandas library, BeautifulSoup library, requests library, exploratory data analysis (EDA)
  - **Link to Notebook:** [Project 3 Notebook](https://github.com/shanirivers/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/notebooks/Coursework%20Projects/Chocolate%20Scraping%20with%20Beautiful%20Soup.ipynb)
  - 
- **Project 4: Diagnosing Diabetes**
  - **Description:** The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) is from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.
  - **Skills Practiced:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to inspect, clean, and validate the data. Python libraries: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Sklearn, graphs
  - **Link to Notebook:** [Project 3 Notebook]()


## About Me

I am passionate about data! 

With a background in supporting and maintaining data for SaaS web application for almost a decade, I am diving into data science, focusing on practical applications of data analysis and machine learning. I currently learning through various online courses (through Codecedemy and LinkedIn), books and self-directed projects.
